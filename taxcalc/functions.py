    The deductions (transport and medical) that are being done away with while
    intrducing Standard Deduction is not captured in the schedule also. Thus,
    the two deductions combined (crude estimate gives a figure of 30000) is
    added to "SALARIES" and then "std_deduction" (introduced as a policy
    variable) is deducted to get "Income_Salary". Standard Deduction is being
    intruduced only from AY 2019 onwards, "std_deduction" is set as 30000 for
    AY 2017 and of 2018 thus resulting in no change for those years.
